# Esp8266-Adler

Electronics and software used to "electrify" a steam model locomotive named "Adler".
Done with visual-studio code and platformio. 
Based on https://github.com/jnweiger/esp8266-esp8266-ota-blink-blink

This code enables OTA (over-the-air) programming of a wemos or esp8266 device.
It features the standard wlan-chooser procedure via an initial access-point (SSID: BlinkBlinkAutoconnectAP).
I have not yet found a way to become a permanent access point (That would be good for robustness, currently
it seems we always need another WLAN to connect to.)
